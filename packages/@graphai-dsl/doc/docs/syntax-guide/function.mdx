# Function

## Calling a Function

```
someFunction();
```

```
someFunction(1, 2);
```

```
someFunction([1, 2, 3]);
```

```
someFunction({x: 1, y: 2});
```

```
someFunction@(params = 1)();
```

## Defining a Function

```
f = (x, y) -> x + y;
```

```
f = ([x, y]) -> x + y;
```

```
f = ({x, y}) -> x + y;
```

```
f = ({x: a, y: b}) -> a + b;
```

```
x = 1;
y = 2;
f = () -> {
  x + y;
};
```

```
f = (x) -> @context.params.a + x;
f@(params = {a: 1})(2);
```

## Currying

Following two are equivalent:

```
f = (x, y) -> x + y;
```

```
f = (x) -> (y) -> x + y;
```

Following two are equivalent:

```
f(1, 2);
```

```
f(1)(2);
```

## Partial Application

```
f = (x, y) -> x + y;
g = f(1);
g(2); // f(1, 2)
```

```
f = (x, y) -> x + y;
1 |> f(2); // f(2, 1)
```

```
[1, 2, 3] |> Array.map((x) -> x * 2)
```
